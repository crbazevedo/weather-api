# Weather API

This repository contains the code for a FastAPI application that generates weather reports for cities around the world. The application uses data from the OpenWeatherMap API and the OpenAI GPT-4 model to generate the reports.

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to generate short weather reports for a given city in the style of a local news reporter. The reports are based on real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The language of the report is determined by the primary language spoken in the city.

The application uses the OpenAI GPT-4 model to generate the reports. The model is given a prompt that includes the city name and the weather data, and it generates a report that includes inside jokes about the city and sounds like it was written by a local news rporter from the city.

Here's an example of a prompt that the application might give to the GPT-4 model:

`Write a short Weather Report for {city} in the style of a local news reporter based on the following data: {weather_data}. Use the language spoken in that city for the report. Add inside jokes about the city and make it sound like a real weather report. Write in the style of a local news reporter who is from {city}.`


In this prompt, `{city}` is replaced with the name of the city and `{weather_data}` is replaced with the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## How to Use

To use this application, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. You can then build and run the Docker image using the following commands:

```bash
docker build -t weather-api .
docker run -p 80:80 weather-api
```


Once the application is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:80`. The application provides two endpoints:

- `/weather/{city}`: Returns the current weather data for the city from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- `/weather-report/{city}`: Returns a weather report for the city generated by the GPT-4 model.

Replace `{city}` with the name of the city you want data for.
